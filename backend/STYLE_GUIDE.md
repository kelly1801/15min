## General Guidelines
- Use PEP 8 as a general style guide for Python code.
- Follow the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle.
- Write clean, readable, and maintainable code.
- Ensure that the code is secure and follows best practices for security.
- Use comments to explain complex or obscure code and to describe the functionality of classes and methods.
- Use version control (Git) for all code changes.

## File Structure
- Keep files organized in a modular structure.
- Use the `models.py` file for database models.
- Use the `views.py` file for API endpoints and business logic.
- Use the `serializers.py` file for serialization and deserialization of data.
- Use the `permissions.py` file for authentication and authorization logic.

## Naming Conventions
- Use descriptive names for classes, methods, and variables.
- Use camelCase for functions and variables, and PascalCase for classes and objects.
- Use singular nouns for model names, and plural nouns for endpoints.
- Avoid abbreviations and acronyms, except for commonly known terms.
- Use underscores for private methods and variables.
- Use all caps for constants.

## API Design
- Follow RESTful API design principles.
- Use HTTP verbs (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, PATCH) to indicate the action being performed.
- Use plural nouns for endpoints (e.g. `/users`, `/posts`).
- Use versioning to handle changes in the API (e.g. `/api/v1/users`).
- Use query parameters for filtering and sorting (e.g. `/posts?user_id=1&sort=-created_at`).
- Use status codes to indicate the outcome of the request.

## Database
- Use Django's built-in ORM for database operations.
- Use migrations to make changes to the database schema.
- Use database indexes for frequently accessed fields.

## Serialization
- Use DRF's built-in serializers for serialization and deserialization of data.
- Use explicit field declarations to prevent over-exposure of sensitive data.
- Use nested serializers for related fields.

## Authentication and Authorization
- Use token-based authentication (JWT).
- Use DRF's built-in authentication classes for handling authentication.
- Use Django's built-in permission classes for handling authorization.
- Use custom permission classes for fine-grained access control.

## Testing
- Write tests for all code changes.
- Use test-driven development (TDD) principles.
- Use test fixtures to simulate data and reduce test setup time.
- Use mocking to isolate functionality and dependencies.

## Libraries and Frameworks
- Use Django and DRF for backend development.
- Use Django extensions for development and debugging.
- Use Celery for asynchronous tasks.
- Use Redis for caching and message queuing.
- Use pytest for testing.
- Use flake8 for linting.

## SOLID Principles
- Follow the SOLID principles for object-oriented design.
- Write classes that have a single responsibility.
- Use dependency injection to reduce coupling.
- Use interfaces
